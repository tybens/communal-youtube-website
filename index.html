<p>I think I want to make a website that could take people's pictures that are created within the
link and make it an option for somebody else to take a picture and upload it to complete the picture
similar to the idea of Bill Clinton with the records but a little more complicated in that it will
be person to person (Idea that I don't like but will write down: shaking hands/dapping up)</p>
<p>Alternative ideas:</p>
<p>  - Chandler holding album.</p>
<p> - different shoes wearing. but I don't think this would work </p>
